# Java Algorithms Practice

This repository is dedicated to **practicing and refreshing algorithms** in Java, with a focus on technical interview (live coding) preparation to refresh core **algorithmic techniques** (two pointers, sliding window, hash map, stack, recursion...
- Prepare for **Java coding interviews** (easy/medium, LeetCode-style problems)
- Write clean and optimal code with clear explanations

---
## Techniques Covered
- Two Pointers (read/write, left/right)
- Sliding Window
- HashMap / HashSet
- Stack / Queue
- Binary Search and variations
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees & Graphs (DFS, BFS)
- Dynamic Programming (easy/medium patterns)
---
## Project Structure
- Each algorithm is implemented in a separate class/file
- Code is written in **Java (JDK 22+)**
- Focus on:
    - **Time complexity (Big-O)**
    - **Space complexity**
    - Alternative solutions where useful

---

This repo is mainly for **practice, learning, and interview preparation**.
